Functional approach studies cell behaviour. In this case we are not looking at the genes that make up a canser, but we are focusing on the cancer itself. By studying the actual behaviour of the cells when exposed to the drug we can find a right drug regardless of what the gene test said. Cancer drugs usually target a scpecific gene mutation, however in practice there is a possibility that these drugs can work also for those patients who do not have the mutation at all.

Testing cancerous cells against drugs in vitro can double median survival time. These sensitivity asseys can also save a lot of resources.
